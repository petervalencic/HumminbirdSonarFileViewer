Modern sonars, such as the Humminbird 998si, allow for the storage of sonar recordings, facilitating their later use and analysis. I have developed a Java application that provides control over these sonar recordings. This application enhances our ability to achieve high-resolution traces, resulting in a more comprehensive data overview compared to the limitations posed by the small screens of these sonar devices.
